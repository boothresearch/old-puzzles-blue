"""
Program to determine whether a word or phrase is an isogram.
An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, 
however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms include:

    lumberjacks
    background
    downstream
    six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.
